## 1. Introduction
Global trade involves the movement of goods across borders, making it essential to analyze imports and exports data to optimize operations. This project applies machine learning techniques to the Imports-Exports dataset to uncover insights and patterns, supporting strategic decision-making in trade and logistics.

## 2. Objective
The primary objectives of this project include:
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw data for analysis.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and relationships.
- Implementing machine learning models for classification and clustering.
- Generating actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency and decision-making.

## 3. Dataset Overview
